  <h1>Deathmatch (DM) :</h1>
🇺🇸  Deathmatching is the act of attacking a player without proper IC motive and/or interaction. Prior interaction should include escalation such as a robbery or a report to the police.

Vehicles cannot be used as weapons in active .

Players must be able to explain their reason and provide proof of prior reasoning if requested.

<h1>Fear Roleplay  (FRP) :</h1>
🇺🇸  Fear Roleplay is the concept of showing appropriate care and concern to preserve your character's safety and life. We aim for balanced gameplay through this rule, and it may not be representative of real life at times. 


Players whose life is in direct danger must RP adequate fear and comply with demands given to them. Direct danger could mean, for example, a gun aimed at your head or at you from close range, by any player. 

A player is not showing proper fear if they run while on foot/bike and a weapon is aimed at them at close range, or if they drive into an active shootout more than once without the intent of providing cover or fleeing with it.

A player has the option to react if they are in a powered vehicle, if they already have a weapon drawn facing their attacker, or if their attacker's view is obstructed by an object.

❗ A player cannot react if they do not have their weapon drawn and they are directly faced by the attacker .
❗  A player cannot cop bait ( you should avoid getting jailed )

<h1>Non-Roleplay (Non-RP)</h1>

<h1>No Crime Zones - green zones (NCZ)</h1>
🇺🇸  No Crime Zones (NCZs) are areas that are considered populated, extremely public, and areas that would have ample security measures such as cameras, staff, and so forth. In these areas, players may not commit any crime, but are allowed to flee, lie, or scam In-Character. 

If a player uses the NCZ for protection the attacker must wait for that player to leave the area. However, players may not go to a NCZ within 15 minutes after engaging in criminal activity or a resulting chase, unless they are turning themselves in to law enforcement.

No Crime Zones are listed below.

Los Santos Bank
